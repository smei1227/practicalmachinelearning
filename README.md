# practicalmachinelearning
This repository contains the R code and the documentation of the final course project of the MOOC Practical Machine Learning on Coursera.

The purpose of the project is to use a Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset collected with wearable accelerometers to predict human activities. The WLE dataset includes 5 classes (sitting-down, standing-up, standing, walking, and sitting) collected on 8 hours of activities of 4 healthy subjects. The detail of the dataset is at <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har>.

The file `README.md` contains a description of the task.

The `index.rmd` contains the RMarkdown file with original R codes and the machine-learning process with Random Forests.

The `index.html` contains the results. In order to run html file, please right-click the `index.html` file and select copy link address. You should have a URL similar to the following structure: "https://github.com/<your user name>/<your repo>/blob/master/index.html"

To use it simply use the following format: "https://rawgit.com/<your user name>/<your repo>/master/index.html"
  
Or simply view the `index.html` [here](https://rawgit.com/smei1227/practicalmachinelearning/gh-pages/index.html).

The knitted RMarkdown file is also published in [Rpub](http://rpubs.com/smei1227/242069).
