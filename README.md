This repository contains the R code and the documentation of the final course project of the MOOC Practical Machine Learning on Coursera.

This is the final project of Coursera Practical Machine Learning course. The purpose of the project is to use a Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset collected with wearable accelerometers to predict the human activities. The WLE dataset includes 5 classes (sitting-down, standing-up, standing, walking, and sitting) collected on 8 hours of activities of 4 healthy subjects.

The file `README.md` contains a description of the task.

The `index.rmd` contains the RMarkdown file with original R codes and the machine-learning process with Random Forests.

The `index.html` contains the results. In order to run html file, please right-click the index.html file and select copy link address. You should have a URL similar to the following structure: "https://github.com/<your user name>/<your repo>/blob/master/index.html"

To use it simply use the following format: "https://rawgit.com/<your user name>/<your repo>/master/index.html"
  
Or simply view the `index.html` [here](https://rawgit.com/smei1227/practicalmachinelearning/gh-pages/index.html).

The knitted RMarkdown file is also published in [Rpub](http://rpubs.com/smei1227/242069).
